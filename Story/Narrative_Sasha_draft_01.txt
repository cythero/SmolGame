- Are we still running, Dylan? Or are we gonna jump this time? 
—-------------------------

Dylan is my husband. I’ve never found anyone as insanely beautiful as him ever since I saw him at that rave on the old pier. It was like in a dream, I was walking to get lost somewhere. I passed by one of the bars and looked at their selection, just to entertain the eye. I never was a drinker.

Then I looked forward and there he was, with his hands behind his back, his stance, powerful like a large cliff in the midst of the forest. It was almost as if he was waiting for me to look at him, and he was already smiling, not in a creepy way - more as if he’d found relief. I walked up to him, infected with a slight side smile, dazed by the parts of his face, uncovered by the soft lights around us.

- Are you alone here? - he leaned in to me and asked. I nodded.
- Not anymore. - he said and smiled.

We were never apart after.

He looked after me and I looked after him.

One night we went to a club, we were going to meet Suzy there. 
She didn't ever show up. We stayed until early in the morning though.

There was an idea that needed brainstorming.

I'd never seen Dylan so driven. It was his way of coping with loss. 
One of his ways...

I knew him so well, I could recognize the look in his eyes when he was about to set everything on fire.
This look always caught me unprepared and it never missed.

As if there was a way to be prepared...

He said the science was already done on his computer. He just had to put it all together and press the key.

We were just playing hide and seek for fucking years after the hack. 
I got to be every woman, he got to be every man.
If you ask me, the worst part about the hack was that it worked. But our plan delivered every step of the way `cos we stuck together. If at any point, one of us decided to bail, that would be the end of us both.… Is there love without loyalty?  
Was I still in love? Absolutely. Did we steal 50 billion? I don’t know, did we?
